// a plan is a map[bucket(planid,contract)] -> [(code,price)]}

// note that pricing here generally could be a function, not a constant.
// but that's future work.

// for most funds there could be just one bucket.

// bucket(T ) -> bucket, chunk
// buckets and chunks must be dense integers 0..N
// it's ok to have 1 bucket and one chunk though.
// chunks can return symbolic chunks that are references to a symbol table.

// this works out to a two level array of byte strings.
// the advantage of a top level directory would be that we could pack the buckets more densely
// by interpolating the top node implicitly we are ensuring that we have non-full buckets.
// but the downside is we have to read that top bucket.
// but we get the same result by having only one bucket. so optional for applications that are not
// helped by imputing
